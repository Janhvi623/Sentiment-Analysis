# Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique that determines whether the data is positive, negative, or neutral. Basically, sentiment analysis is performed on textual data.
This is a very useful technique that is used to help businesses to monitor brands and products according to customer feedback and understand customer needs.

# What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment analysis is nothing, it just recognizes the sentiment behind the text. It is often used by businesses to detect sentiment in social data, product reputation, and understanding customers.

Nowadays, customers share their thoughts and feelings more openly (In feedback forms and in comments on a particular product). So that’s why sentiment analysis has become very essential to monitor and understand the sentiment of customers.

There are basically two types of sentiment analysis:
Emotion detection: In this sentiment analysis technique we generally detect emotions, like happiness, frustration, anger, sadness, and so on.
Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis: In this type of sentiment analysis we basically analyze the sentiments behind the texts. For example, aspect-based sentiment analysis can be used when you want particular aspects or features of people giving a product review as positive, neutral, and negative.
So these are the basic two types of sentiment analysis and in this python sentiment analysis project, we will perform Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis.

Before discussing the Project that we are going to implement, let’s first understand what natural language processing is?

# About Natural language Processing:
Natural language processing (NLP) enables computers to communicate with humans. With the help of NLP, it is possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiments, and also with the help of NLP we can determine which part of text is important.

NLP allows machines to break down and interpret human language. Natural Language processing techniques are widely used for Projects like chatbot creation, spam filters, Social media monitoring, etc.

# About Sentiment Analysis Project:
This is a Machine Learning project, in which with the help of machine learning algorithms and techniques we will classify the sentiment of text that is positive, negative, or neutral.

# Sentiment Analysis Dataset
The dataset we will be using to develop this machine learning sentiment analysis project is Twitter US Airline Sentiment which is available on the following link: Sentiment Analysis Dataset

The dataset is basically a CSV file that consists of 30 columns. With the help of this data, we will train our ml model that will predict the sentiment of the text as positive, neutral, or negative.

# Sentiment Analysis Machine Learning Project Code
Please download the sentiment analysis project code from the following link: Sentiment Analysis Project Code

# Required Libraries:
You need to install certain libraries in your system to implement the python sentiment analysis project. The required libraries are:

Numpy (pip install numpy)
Pandas (pip install pandas)
Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
Natural language Processing toolkit (NLTK) (pip install nltk)
Sklearn (pip install sklearn)
In this ml project, we will require these libraries. To install this on your system you can use pip installer. So open your command prompt and type pip install numpy, pip install pandas, etc.
